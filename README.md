# NBasic
The NBasic programming language. A BASIC-esque language that isn't meant for serious projects.

#Installing
To install NBasic, download the JAR. Write a program or download an example, and then compile it with the following:
`java -jar nbasic.jar [file to be compiled]`
..and then sit back as nbasic interprets your program.

#Using NBasic
##Printing:

To print something in NBasic, type out the following:
`print: "[your text]"`
Example: `print: "Hello World"`

To print a variable:
`print: [variable name]`
Example: `print: myVar`

##Variables
To create a variable, type out the following:
`[variable type]: [variable name]: [variable value]`
Example: `num: a: 100`
