##Tutorial

To print something, just type "print:", followed by the value you want to print.

**print: Hello World**

To create a variable, declare it's datatype and value.

**string: greeting: Hello World**

To print a variable, instead of a value, put a variable name.

**printv: greeting**

As you can see, the syntax uses colons to declare name and value. Built in Functions are very similar.

**add: 100: 100**

Currently, this prints out the addition of 100 + 100.  Other functions include "add", "sub", "mul", "div".
