# NBasic

Simple BASIC-Like language for quick and dirty hacks. Currently in heavy development.

##Tutorial

To print something, just type "print:", followed by the value you want to print.

**print: "Hello World"**

To create a variable, declare it's datatype and value.

**string: greeting: "Hello World"**

You may print variables as well.

**print: greeting**

There are other math functions available to use such as "add", "sub", "mul", "div", "cos", "sin", "tan", etc.

**num: a: 100**

**num: b: 50**

**add: a: b**

You can also have functions.

**function: functionName: functionAction**

While and for loops are implemented, so are if statements. As of NBasic 1.2 all GUI functionality has been removed.

Older versions of NBasic are on the "jw" branch
